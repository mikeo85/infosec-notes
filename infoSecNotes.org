* Architecture & Design Security
** Access Control
*** AAA - Authorization, Authentication, and Accounting
*** RADIUS (Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service)
- Common access control protocol
- Centralize authentication for users across all different devices (routers, switches, firewalls, servers, VPN, wireless)
- Available for most operating systems
*** TACACS
*** KERBEROS
- Authenticate once, trusted by system
- No need to reauthenticate to everything
- Encryption prevents MITM
- Provides SSO functionality
*** LDAP (Lightweight directory access protocol)
- protocol for reading and writing directories over an IP network
- standardized X.500 protocol
- Creates attribute=value pairs
- hierarchical structure - containers and leafs
*** LOCAL AUTHENTICATION
- creds stored on local device, not centralized
- Difficult to scale
- Can be useful as backup, eg if AAA server is unavailable
*** Certificate-based authentication
- Private key, usually stored on smart card or similar
- Also often stored on laptop, USB drive
*** Auditing
** Software Development
*** SDLC - An organized process of decveloping a secure application throughout the life of the project
- SDLC Phases (as CompTIA defines them) /LEARN THESE PHASES FOR EXAM/
  - Planning & Analysis
  - Software / System design
  - Implementation
  - Testing
  - Integration
  - Deployment
  - Maintenance
    - Version control
    - Configuration management
- SDLC Principles
  - CIA Triad
  - Threat modeling
  - Least privilege
  - Defense in depth
  - Never trust user input
  - Minimize attack surface
  - Create secure defaults
  - Authenticity & integrity
  - Fail securely
  - Fix security issues
  - Rely on trusted SDKs
*** Testing Methods
- System Testing
  - Black Box
    - no info about system before test
  - White Box
    - full details of a system provided before test, including source code, diagram, user creds, etc
  - Gray Box
    - given some info, but not all info
- Structured Exception Handling
- Input Validation
- Static analysis
  - review of source code
- Dynamic analysis
  - analysis and testing of program while being executed or run
- Fuzzing
  - injection of random data into program and find system failures, etc
*** Software vulnerabilities and exploits
- Backdoors
- Directory traversal
  - Example: using ../ repeatedly in a web url, trying to get to root of webserver
    : https://www.diontraining.com/menu?menu=../../../../etc/passwd
     ==> Trying to get to root of diontraining.com server then traverse to the /etc/passwd file. If successful, would print text file of passwords on the screen
- Arbitrary Code Execution
- Remote code execution (RCE)
- Zero Day
- Buffer Overflow
  - When process stores data outside the memory range allocated by the developer. I.e. attempt to put more data into memory than it is designed to hold.
  - Mitigation: Address Space Layout Randomization
    - Method used by programmers to randomly arrange the different address spaces used by a program or process to prevent buffer overflow exploits
- XSS - Cross-Site Scripting
  - Attacker embeds malicious scripting commands on a trusted website
  - Stored/Persistent
  - Reflected
  - DOM-Based (client-side)
  - Mitigation: Output encoding, proper input validation
- XSRF - Cross-site request forgery
  - Attacker forces user to execute actions on a web server where they are already authenticated
  - Mitigation: tokens, encryption, XML file scanning, cookie verification
- SQL Injection
  - Injection of SQL query via input data from client to web application
  - Usually SQL, HTML, XML, or LDAP code used... MOSTLY SQL
    *FOR THE EXAM* If you see /`OR 1=1;/ or any similar code that would always be true, it is an SQL INJECTION
  - PREVENTION: Input validation
** Network Design
*** OSI Model
- Application
- Presentation
- Session
- Transport
- Network
- Data Link
- Physical
- /Mnemonic: Please Do Not Throw Sausage Pizza Away/
*** Switches
- Security through intelligent use of MAC addresses
- Attacks:
  - MAC Flooding
    - Attempt to overwhelm the limited switch memory set asside to store the MAC addresses for each port
    - Can cause switch to fail-open, begin to act like hub (i.e. send packates to all connected devices, not just selecting by MAC address)
  - MAC Spoofing
    - Attacker masks MAC address to pretend to be another device
    - Often combined with ARP spoofing
  - Physical Tampering
- Routers
  - Access control list (ACL) -- attack via IP spoofing
  - Often insecure out-of-the-box
*** Network Zones
- LAN
- WAN
- DMZ
- Subnets
*** Network Access Control (NAC)
- Devices sare scanned to determine current state prior to being allowed onto the network
- Enter network only on pass assessment
- Persistent vs Non-Persistent agents
- Port-based NAC: 802.1x
*** VLANs
- Segment the network
- reduce collisions
- organize the network
- boost performance
- increase security
- Attacks
  - Switch spoofing: attacker configures device to pretend it is a switch, negotiate trunk link to break out of vlan
  - Double tagging - attacker adds additional VLAN tags to creat outer and inner tag
*** Subnetting
- compartmentalization
- subnet policies and monitoring can aid in security of network
*** NAT - Network Address Translation
- Changing IP address while it transits across a router
- NAT can help us hide our network IPs
- *Port Address Translation* - Router keeps track of requests from internal hosts by using random high number ports for each request
- /Exam note:/ Refresh on Private IP ranges
  - Class A / Class B / Class C
  - Private IP addresses can never be transmitted over the internet
*** Telephony
- Devices that provide voice communication
** Perimeter Security
- Boundary between LAN & WAN
*** Firewalls
- Packet filtering -- stateless & statefull
  - Stateless: accept or reject packets based on ACL rules
  - Statefull: tracks packets leaving the network and only allows matching inbound
- NAT Filtering
- Explicit Allow, Explicit Deny, Implicit Deny
*** Web Application Firewalls
- Traffic control on data sent to and from a web app
*** Proxy Server
- Disable Proxy Auto-configuration file (PAC) for security
*** NIDS vs. NIPS
**** NIDS - Network Intrusion Detection System
- Attempts to detect, log, and alert on malicious network activities
- Usually placed right behind the firewall
- Promiscuous mode -- see all network traffic on a segment (e.g. Span port on network switch)
- Only uses signature based rules or heuristics. Logs and alerts -- no preventive action.
**** NIPS - Network Intrusion Prevention System
- Attempts to remove, detain, or redirect malicious traffic
- Must be *in-line* of network traffic flow
**** May have built-in protocol analyizer - AKA Deep Packet Inspection
*** UTM - Unified Threat Management
- AKA Next Generation Firewall (NGFW)
- May include firewall, NIDS/NIPS, content filter, antimalware, dlp, and vpn
** Cloud Computing
*** Know the 4 types:
- Public
- Private
- Hybrid
- Community
*** As A Service
- Infrastructure
- Platform
- Software
*** Domain Controller - Active Directory Attack
- Kerberos attack called "golden ticket"
* Cloud
** Microsoft Azure
https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/azureessentials/Pivot/AzureEssentials/AzureInfrastructure/Watch
- PaaS - Platform as a service - MSFT runs compute & app services, you manage apps & data
- IS - Infrastructure as a service - MSFT manage compute, storage, & network infrastructure, you manage everything else
- 40 global regions (collections of data centers)
- Compute -- run VMs, set up your own or use pre-configured VMs
* Cryptography & PKI Security
* Docker
*** [[http://codeopolis.com/posts/25-basic-docker-commands-for-beginners/][25 Basic Docker Commands for Beginners]]
*** You can see the containers on your computer using:
: docker container ls
*** Remove all images and containers
- *Warning: This will destroy all your images and containers. There is no way to restore them!*
**** Run those commands in a shell:
: docker rm $(docker ps -a -q)
: docker rmi $(docker images -q)
****  In case you want to delete even those images that are referenced in repositories, use:
: docker rmi $(docker images -q) --force
* Emacs
** Org Mode
- Convert text or headings to list
: C-c -
- Mark (select) entire subtree: =C-c @=
  - can then delete, for example
*** Tables
- https://orgmode.org/worg/org-tutorials/tables.html
- https://orgmode.org/manual/Built_002din-Table-Editor.html
**** Creating a table
Create a table from scratch using =C-c |=

Or start by typing the "|" character at the beginning of a line and between column headers. 
: |One | Two | Three
Then =C-c RET= to automatically generate the headers and separator row as follows:
| One | Two | Three |
|-----+-----+-------|
|     |     |       |

Or Start the second line with "|-" to create the header separator row:
: | One | Two | Three |
: |-
Then =TAB= to get:
| One | Two | Three |
|-----+-----+-------|
|     |     |       |
**** Working with table
- Copy down from previous cell =S-RET=
- Blank field at point =C-c SPC=
*** Refile
- Org-refile =C-c C-w=
- Add file to org-agenda-files (to be a refile target) =C-c [=
** Dired
*** Editing the Dired Buffer =C-x C-q=
Wdired is a special mode that allows you to perform file operations by editing the Dired buffer directly (the “W” in “Wdired” stands for “writable”). To enter Wdired mode, type C-x C-q (dired-toggle-read-only) while in a Dired buffer. Alternatively, use the ‘Immediate / Edit File Names’ menu item.

While in Wdired mode, you can rename files by editing the file names displayed in the Dired buffer. All the ordinary Emacs editing commands, including rectangle operations and query-replace, are available for this. Once you are done editing, type C-c C-c (wdired-finish-edit). This applies your changes and switches back to ordinary Dired mode.

Apart from simply renaming files, you can move a file to another directory by typing in the new file name (either absolute or relative). To mark a file for deletion, delete the entire file name. To change the target of a symbolic link, edit the link target name which appears next to the link name.

** General
- Mark multiple lines as comments: select region, then =M-;= (Note: same thing to un-comment)
- =M-u= upcase word (make word uppercase from point)
** Macro
- Define kbd macro =C-x (=
- End macro =C-x )=
- Execute macro =C-x e=
* Firefox
** Tweaks
*** How to restore the old Firefox address bar [[https://www.ghacks.net/2020/04/08/how-to-restore-the-old-firefox-address-bar/][source gHacks]]
1. Load about:config in the browser's address bar.
2. Confirm that you will be careful.
3. Search for the following preferences and set them all to FALSE
   : browser.urlbar.openViewOnFocus
   : browser.urlbar.update1
   : browser.urlbar.update1.interventions
   : browser.urlbar.update1.searchTips

* Identity & Access Management (IAM) Security
* Linux
*** PACKAGE MANAGEMENT
**** Remove PPA
- Using APT in Terminal
: sudo add-apt-repository --remove ppa:PPA_name/ppa
- Using source list in Terminal
: sudo ls /etc/apt/sources.list.d
Look for desired PPA and remove using
: sudo rm -i /etc/apt/sources.list.d/PPA_name
*** Cron
- start cronjob scripts with =#!/bin/bash -l= so they pick up the ~/.bash_profile environment variables
- edit crontab with =crontab -e=
- =crontab -l= to list user crontab
- reload (probably superfluous): =sudo service cron reload=
*** KDE Desktop Environment
**** Quit/Restart
Open terminal or Run dialog (Ctrl + F2)
: killall plasmashell #to stop it
: kstart plasmashell #to restart it
*** Wifi/Ethernet
**** Network not connecting
- Reset network manager:
sudo systemctl restart NetworkManager
*** Cron
see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/CronHowto
*** Install .deb
Download deb file
In terminal: 
cd to deb location
dpkg -i *.deb
*** fdupes – A Command Line Tool to Find and Delete Duplicate Files in Linux
- ref: https://www.tecmint.com/fdupes-find-and-delete-duplicate-files-in-linux/
- Suggested use:
  - Review all duplicates, recursive, multiple directories, with filesize: =$ fdupes -S -R <dir1> <dir2> > ~/fdupeslist.txt=
  - Same search, delete files (prompted one set at a time): =$ fdupes -d -R <dir1> <dir2>=
* Networking
(TCP/IP/switching/routing/protocols,etc.)
** Network Tools
*** IP Scanner: Arp-Scan
sudo arp scan -l
- modifier -l scans local network
- can also specify by IP/Subnet or by IP range, e.g.
  - sudo arp-scan 192.168.1.0/24     #Scans 192.168.1.0 255.255.255.0
  - sudo arp-scan 192.168.1.1-192.168.1.254     #Scans the obvious range
- http://itswapshop.com/articles/top-3-ip-scanners-linux
*** Port Scanner: nmap
sudo nmap -sP 192.168.1.0/24     #Scans 192.168.1.0 255.255.255.0
sudo nmap -sP 192.168.1.1-254     #Scans the obvious range

can also be used as an IP scanner, but slower than arp-scan.

** IP - Internet Protocol
*** PROTOCOL: TCP & UDP - OSI Layer 4 - Transport Layer
**** TCP - Transmission control protocol
- Connection-oriented (setup & close)
- Reliable delivery - get acknowledgement
- Flow control
**** UDP - User Datagram Protocol
- Connectionless protocol -- no verification, open or close
- "unreliable" - no return verification
- No flow control
*** Port Number - where the packet needs to go within the IP address device
- Non-ephemeral ports -- permanent port numbers (usually used by services)
- Ephemeral (temporary) port numbers
- Port numbers are for communication, not security
- Ports tell the server/device which application needs to get the data in the packet

** RAID - Redundant Array of Independent Disks
- Allows the combination of multiple physical hard disks into a single logical hard disk drive that is recognized by the operating system.
- Can provide redundancy and high-availability (depending on which RAID method used)
- Striping: Spreading data across several disks. Increases retrieval time. Does not improve reliability -- if any of the disks fails, the entire drive data is lost.
- Mirroring: Copy data from one disk onto two or more disks. Provides reliability -- if any disk fails, the data is still contained on the other disk(s).
- Fault-Resistant RAID: Protects against the loss of the array's data if a single disk fails (RAID 1 or RAID 5)
- Fault-Tolerant RAID: Protects against the loss of the array's data if a single component fails (RAID 1, RAID 5, RAID 6)
- Disaster-Tolerant RAID: Provides two independent zones with full access to the data (RAID 10)
| RAID    | DRIVES | DESCRIPTION                                                                                                                                  |
|---------+--------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| RAID 0  |     2+ | Data striping across multiple disks to increase performance. No fault tolerance.                                                             |
| RAID 1  |     2+ | Mirring the data identically onto two hard disks. Fault tolerance. Relatively expensive.                                                     |
| RAID 5  |     3+ | Striping data across multiple disks and spreads parity data across the disks. Provides combination of reliability and increased performance. |
| RAID 6  |     4+ | Modified form of RAID 5. Provides redundancy by striping and double parity data across the disk drives. Survive failure of up to 2 disks.    |
| RAID 10 |     4+ | Striped RAID of two mirrored RAIDs. i.e. RAID 0 array of two RAID 1 sets. Fault tolerant & Disaster tolerant                                 |
* Programming
(programming concepts/scripting/object orientation basics)
** BASH
*** Find list of files and replace keyword or string in the filename
: find <starting_dir> -name '*<string>*' -exec bash -c ' mv -v "$0" "${0/<string>/<newstring>}" ' {} \;
- if using special characters such as '-' or '|', escape them with '\'
- May need to run it a few times in case some files have the string multiple times in the name. e.g., if file name is =foo-foo.txt= and you replace 'foo' with 'bar' then running once would result in =bar-foo.txt=. A second run is required to reach =bar-bar.txt=.

** Best practices
- Disable PowerShell for regular users
  Most regular users have zero reason to be using PowerShell. [[file:NOTES_InfoSecLearning.org][Reference]]
- Use Group Policy to prohibit unsigned executables from running in user profile directories.
  This cuts about 80% of the application noise & issues.

* Security General Concepts
** Security Definitions
- *INFORMATION SECURITY:* Act of protecting data and information from unauthorized access, unlawful modification and disruption, disclosure, corruption, and destruction.
- *INFORMATION SYSTEMS SECURITY:* Act of Protecting the systems that hold and process our critical data
** AAA of Security
*** Authentication
When a person's identity is established with proof and confirmed by a system
*** Authorization
- Approved access to a certain piece of data or areas of building
*** Accounting
- tracking of data, computer usage, and network resources
- non-repudiation = proof
  - e.g. log file
* Security Technologies & Tools
** Hardening
- Restricting Applications
  - Minimize applications
  - Standardized baseline configuration
  - SCCM
- Application whitelist / blacklist
*** Trusted Operating System
- Any operating system that meets the requirements set forth by the government and has multilevel security
** Application Security
- Cookies
  - Know tracking cookies vs. session cookies
- Windows - User Account Control
  - Prevents unauthorized axccess and avoids user error in the form of accidental changes
* Threats, Attacks, & Vulnerabilities
** Security Threats
- Malware
- Unauthorized Access
- System Failure
- Social Engineering
** Mitigating Threats
- Physical controls
- Technical controls
- Administrative controls
** Hackers
- White hat
- Black hat
- Gray hat
- Blue hat (like white hat --- but freelance... e.g. bug bounty program)
- Elite (could be white hat or black hat)
** Threat Actors
- Script kiddies
- Hacktivist
- Organized Crime
- Advanced Persistent Threats (often Nation States)
** Malware
Software designed to infiltrate a computer system and possibly dmage it without the user's consent
*** Virus
*Exam expects knowledge of 10 categories -- see study guide*
Requires user action
*** Worm
self-replicate without user consent or action
*** Trojan
hidden malicious function in "harmless" or desirable software
*** Ransomware
*** Spyware
adware, keyloggers, etc.
grayware -- software that isn't benign or malicious, behaves improperly but without serious consequences (aka "jokeware")
*** Rootkit
- administrative level control over a system without detection
- *DLL Injection* - malicious code inserted into running process on Win machine by taking advantage of Dynamic Link Libraries that are loaded at runtime.
- *Driver Manipulation*
- *Shim* - intercept calls between components and redirect to malicous elements
*** Spam
- mostly just ads, just annoying
 -but can have embedded malware
** Malware infections
Two pieces of how malware gets onto a machine:
1. Threat vector (method used by attacker to access victim machine)
2. Attack vector (method used by attacker to gain access to victim's machine in order to infect it with malware)
*** Common delivery methods
- software, messaging, and media
- watering hole
  - compromised or spoofed website with malware downloads
  - typosquatting
*** Botnets & Zombies
- zombie -- under control of attacker, part of botnet
*** Logic Bomb
- malicious code that has been inserted inside a program and will execute only when certain conditions have been met
